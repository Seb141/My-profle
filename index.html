	<h2>Weight Training/Crossfit</h2>
        <p>I've been doing those two sports for 4 years now. I started crossfit and weight training because i was uncomfortable with my body on the daily basis. It brings me confidence in myself and its good for physical and mental health. I became an addict this year and even though I reached my goals I have the intention to keep grinding.

	<h2>Music</h2>
        <p>I started playing instruments at the age of 6 years old. The percussions were my instruments and i liked it a lot but I stopped when I was 14 because of a lack of time. Music is still in my life, I listen to music at least 5 hours a day. It may seem a lot but it just make the day easier for me.
        </p>

	<h2>Cinema</h2>
       <p>Some might say going to the cinema is not a passion, well guess what? It is. I like watching movies, paying attention to details. To find the meaning behind the movie and what is the message behind and how it is presented. The ideas of realisation (shot,angles...)

	<h2>Slope</h2>
       <p>Slope is a video game which goal is to get a little ball the furthest possible down a slope full of pitfalls. I started playing this game a month ago and immediatley fell in love with it. My high score is 90, I wish you good luck to beat me. My goal is to beat my friend Romain whose high score is 150.
